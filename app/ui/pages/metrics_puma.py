    - Mercado Livre has a price range from R$49.99 to R$595.65, with a mean of R$299.42. This site appears to target budget-conscious customers.    
    
    - Puma website has a much wider price range (R$119.90 to R$1,999.90), with a mean of R$592.05, suggesting it caters to a broader audience, including premium segments.
    
    - The Puma Site and Magalu exhibit higher maximum prices (R$1,999.90 and R$1,079.99, respectively), which could be outliers pushing up the mean and increasing the standard deviation. This is evident in the longer upper whiskers in the box plot.
